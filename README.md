The objective of the project is to parse and process the Million Song dataset to support knowledge extraction over different features
like songs genres, artists etc. using Hadoop MapReduce programs.

Analysis has been performed to answer the following questions.

**Q1.** For each artist, what is the most commonly tagged genre?

**Q2.** What is the average tempo across all the songs in the dataset?

**Q3.** What is the median danceability score across all the songs in the dataset?

**Q4.** Who are the top ten artists for fast songs (based on their tempo)?

**Q5.** What are top ten songs based on their hotness in each genre? Please also provide the artist name and title for these songs.
        
**Q6.** On a per-year basis, what is the mean variance of loudness across the songs within the dataset?

**Q7.** How many songs does each artist have in this dataset?

**Q8.** What are the top ten most popular terms (genres) that songs in the dataset have been tagged with?
